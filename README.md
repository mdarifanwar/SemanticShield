## Overview

SemanticShield is an intelligent plagiarism detection platform that analyzes uploaded documents and identifies exact, near-duplicate, and semantically similar content.

The system combines Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and document analysis techniques to generate detailed plagiarism reports with sentence-level insights and section-wise analysis.

Unlike traditional keyword matching approaches, SemanticShield focuses on semantic similarity and contextual relationships between documents.

## Sample Workflow

1. Upload a PDF, DOCX, or TXT file.
2. Text is extracted automatically.
3. Document is split into sentences.
4. Features are generated.
5. Machine Learning model evaluates similarity.
6. Plagiarism score is calculated.
7. Detailed report is generated.
8. Results are visualized on the dashboard.
